Here's a structured template for writing a README based on the instructions you provided:
1. ### Project Title
Employability Analytics for Software Developer Roles

Here is Graphical User Interface (GUI) image:

2. ### Project Description
The study analyzes job market data from the Kaggle dataset to look at employability trends for software developers. The joblocation_address, postdate, jobtitle, and skills fields in the data set allow for the generation of useful knowledge. 

Here is an iamge of our dataset which is taken from Kaggle:

3. ### Table of Contents
We have several filters that are involved in dataset.
# company
# employmenttype_jobstatus
# jobdescription
# jobid
# joblocation_address
# jobtitle
# postdate
# skills
# uniq_id
Here is the clear image of that:

4. ### Installation / Setup
Steps to get the project up and running.
- Started research on dataset in some websites and finally found 22,000 records in Kaggle. Later reduced and deleted some of the duplicates to 300 records to easier the output.
- Uploaded that dataset in Excel sheet and got some visuals to outline the design of the project
- By using python code in visual studio, everything got categorized into filters which are mentioned in the contents.
- Also we can find out how many count of skills are there in a particular company.
- Created some of the wireframes using Lucid Chart. With that we can go into the user login page and that user is redirected to the dashboard page.
- Then at that point you can see the other three filters which are related to the current job market trends.
- some of the visuals like piecharts, bargraphs are popped up about the count of post dates in each company so that user can better idea on how many openings are there in that. You can also view the skills from those graphs.


### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Harshgit2025/Team-20_Readme-File.git

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'



### 3. Install requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
  flask
  visual studio
  

5. ### Usage
The application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring job market insights and career recommendations.

python app.py
To train the model:
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch-size 32
To test:
python test.py

## Trends with Job Market Insights*.
- Job Suggestion Engine: Receive specific guidance on potential job paths.
- Skill Gap Analysis: Determine training opportunities and in-demand skills.
- Employer Insights: Examine hiring patterns and desired credentials.

  # To analyze job market trends:
  python
  from src.analysis import JobMarketAnalyzer
  analyzer = JobMarketAnalyzer()
  trends = analyzer.get_job_trends(industry="IT", location="United States")
  print(trends)
  
  # To generate a career path recommendation:
  python
  from src.career_engine import CareerEngine
  engine = CareerEngine()
  recommendation = engine.get_recommendation(skills=["Python", "Data Analysis"], experience=3)
  print(recommendation)
